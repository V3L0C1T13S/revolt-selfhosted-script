# revolt-selfhosted-script
Script to automatically deploy and run Revolt's entire stack.

NOTE: This script is made for Ubuntu 22.04. Other Debian-based systems may also work.

## Quick start
`git clone https://github.com/V3L0C1T13S/revolt-selfhosted-script`

`cd revolt-selfhosted-script`

`./setup.sh`

`./launch.sh`

## Known major bugs
Vortex will not compile, so it's excluded from this script.
